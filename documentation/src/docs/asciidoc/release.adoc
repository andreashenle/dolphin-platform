= Dolphin Platform release documentation
This chapter describes how a new release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

== Dolphin Platform repositories
The sources of the Dolphin Platform are seperated in several repositories:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[GitHub repository of the Java API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[GitHub repository of the JavaScript basic client API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[GitHub repository of the Polymer client API]

In addition we provide several repositories that contain jumpstarts for the Dolphin Platform. This repositories
should be released with each release of the Dolphin Platform:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[Dolphin Platform Lazybones template for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-kumuluz-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a JavaEE
based jumpstart]

== Dolphin Platform repositories walkthrough
For a release the repositories shoud be released in a defined order to create a accurate release. The following
documentation shows a step by step instruction to release all repositories. In general a release starts by releasing
the sources of the JavaScript API repositores followed by the Java repository. Once this is done the jumpstart related
repositories can be released in any order.

=== Install needed tools for the release
TODO: some tools must be installed on the local machine. Add overview for all tools

=== Realising the JavaScript repositories
A developer should always start to release the *JavaScript basic API*. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[JavaScript basic API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* A release will always be done on the master branch.
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project
* If the build executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json`, `gulpfile.js` (in `gulpfile.js` search for the `sonar` task)
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.8.7`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the JavaScript basic API has been released

As a next step the *Poylmer API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[Polymer API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* A release will always be done on the master branch.
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* Once this is done the dependency to the JavaScript basic API must be updated. To do so the `version` number of
the `dolphin-js` dependency in the `bower.json` must be changed to the new version.
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project.
* If the build executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json` and `package.json`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.8.7`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the Polymer basic API has been released

As a next step the *AngularJS API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-angularjs[AngularJS API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* A release will always be done on the master branch.
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* Once this is done the dependency to the JavaScript basic API must be updated. To do so the `version` number of
the `dolphin-js` dependency in the `bower.json` must be changed to the new version.
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project.
* If the build executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json` and `package.json`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.8.7`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the AngularJS basic API has been released


=== Realising the Java repository

* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.8.7`)
* Check out the created release branch
* update the dependecies of all JavaScript modules in the `platform-examples` folder to the new version
* Try all examples
* update the version number in the `gradle.properties` file
* check the changelog in the documentation if all changes are mentioned
* Call `gradle clean build` from the project folder to check that the build is working
* Call `gradle clean bintrayUpload` from the project folder
* Create a tag from the release branch. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.8.7`
* Upload the tag is to the global repository at GitHub
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central
